[19:39:30] [Async Chat Thread - #16/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Hey, you're not afk now! :P
[19:39:31] [Async Chat Thread - #16/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Yo!
[19:39:49] [Async Chat Thread - #16/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Yeah, Photoshop was loading slow so I popped back over here lol
[19:46:59] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Don't jump down the mine.
[20:14:32] [Async Chat Thread - #18/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> :O you look armory!
[20:14:45] [Async Chat Thread - #18/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Yeah, I've been trying to build up some experience...
[20:14:57] [Async Chat Thread - #18/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Creepers kept sneaking up on me >_<
[20:15:30] [Async Chat Thread - #18/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> ahh... And they're creepers, so they don't stop when you ask :(
[20:15:59] [Async Chat Thread - #18/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> So now I'm gonna patch up all the craters I've left behind...
[20:32:32] [Async Chat Thread - #19/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I don't remember a lot of redstone tricks anymore :(
[20:33:20] [Async Chat Thread - #19/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Same T_T
[20:39:38] [Async Chat Thread - #20/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Whatcha trying to do with the redstone?
[20:39:49] [Async Chat Thread - #20/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> trying to elevator
[20:40:06] [Async Chat Thread - #20/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Ah, yeah, those are always frustrating...
[20:45:32] [Async Chat Thread - #21/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> And... somehow I made the pistons just constantly go on and off O_O
[20:49:16] [Async Chat Thread - #22/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Did you ever find slimes?

[21:40:38] [Async Chat Thread - #23/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> It's in the loot room
[21:40:53] [Async Chat Thread - #23/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> how'd we get a slime here!
[21:41:11] [Async Chat Thread - #23/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I dunno, maybe we're in a slime generating chunk afterall?
[21:43:18] [Async Chat Thread - #24/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> we light it up so well we'd never know lol
[21:43:37] [Async Chat Thread - #24/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I think maybe slimes can spawn in the light? I forget how it works...
[21:43:52] [Async Chat Thread - #24/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> They have a maximum light level don't they?
[21:44:08] [Async Chat Thread - #24/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Honestly, I'd have to check...
[21:45:01] [Async Chat Thread - #24/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> bleh... it's stopping just short

[21:47:47] [Async Chat Thread - #25/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> What dark magic is this?!
[21:47:54] [Async Chat Thread - #25/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> super dark.
[21:48:10] [Async Chat Thread - #25/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I acquired it by the book of darkest magics.
[21:48:23] [Async Chat Thread - #25/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> It's called "The google"
[21:48:32] [Async Chat Thread - #25/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> How do you turn it on?
[21:48:37] [Async Chat Thread - #25/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> button on the wall
[21:49:00] [Async Chat Thread - #25/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> This is amazing!
[21:49:13] [Async Chat Thread - #25/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I know! it looked too easy to not try lol
[21:49:58] [Async Chat Thread - #25/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> i think I need to dig a new water hole to accomodate walls for it though :(
[21:57:20] [Async Chat Thread - #26/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Did you figure out your shrooms?
[21:57:38] [Async Chat Thread - #26/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Kinda.
[21:57:50] [Async Chat Thread - #26/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I haven't designed a collection system yet...
[22:05:21] [Async Chat Thread - #27/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Hm...
[22:05:37] [Async Chat Thread - #27/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I don't know why sometimes it fails...
[22:06:09] [Async Chat Thread - #27/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Did they break bonemeal?
[22:08:30] [Async Chat Thread - #28/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> hey, there it is! :D
[22:11:56] [Async Chat Thread - #29/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Does it work well?
[22:12:17] [Async Chat Thread - #29/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Yeah, only problem is it looks like bonemeal doesn't have a 100% chance of growing one...
