[00:45:35] [Server thread/INFO]: Dejitaru_Davis was shot by Skeleton
[00:46:56] [Async Chat Thread - #59/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Good evening. It is late lol
[00:47:17] [Async Chat Thread - #59/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Maybe for you, grandpa :P
[00:49:04] [Async Chat Thread - #60/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Zombies seem to like wheat :P
[00:49:59] [Async Chat Thread - #60/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Have we built an anvil yet?
[00:50:05] [Async Chat Thread - #60/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Yes
[00:50:13] [Async Chat Thread - #60/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> it's in the mine area treasure room.
[00:50:17] [Async Chat Thread - #60/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Is it in the mine--cool.
[00:52:52] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I have a better tree farming solution as well :P
[00:52:59] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Yeah?
[00:53:27] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Whoa
[00:53:41] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> it stops the trees from being ridiculous when you're doing the oak too.
[00:53:57] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Does this work for pine and the other types, too?
[00:54:24] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Although I think when they grow against the back wall they can somehow touch the lava and start on
[00:54:26] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> fire...
[00:54:33] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> so i gotta deal with that sometime.
[00:54:40] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Also, FYI Jungle trees have a different sapling drop rate...
[00:54:46] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Yes... They do :(

[00:54:52] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> For some reason they drop half as frequently...
[00:54:53] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> It is sucky.
[00:54:58] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Evening Duckmaste.
[00:55:05] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> oh olord
[00:55:06] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I guess to counter against growing the GIANT jungle trees...which have more leaves.
[00:55:12] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Or as you prefer Ducknasty.
[00:55:22] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> is this just a path or real redstone circuit?!
[00:55:24] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Back when all wood was the same I'd farm the big jungle trees because you got more wood per sapling.
[00:55:26] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I don't think that's an issue?
[00:55:42] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I think you gotta do special stuff to grow the crazy huge ones.
[00:55:52] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I gotta work on that a bit...
[00:56:02] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Yeah...four in a square + bone meal used to be the method.
[00:56:04] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> getting to the table is a bit awkward, i put the one bookshelf too low
[00:56:06] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Not sure about now...
[00:56:19] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> ...Clever.
[00:56:22] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> BTW, crafting table is the ceiling.
[00:56:31] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> if u break the bookshelf, you just need 6 wood and crafting table to put it back together
[00:56:46] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Yeah, but I was being lazy and it was the last one to hit 30.
[00:56:58] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Also, enchanting is weird now.
[00:57:00] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> i'm 1 :'(
[00:57:09] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Enchanting was ALWAYS weird :(
[00:57:11] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> You need 2 more.
[00:57:12] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> you gotta use lapiz blue shit to see what 1 of hte things is right?
[00:57:18] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> it cost me 3 levels to get max enchant..
[00:57:51] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Where's the enchanting table at?
[00:57:53] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> There's enough potatos in the furnaces down here to get you enough to do a good enchant i think
[00:57:58] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> down from 12 aka main flooor
[00:58:06] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> there's 2 spots to go down, pick the correct one
[00:58:06] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> thataway
[00:58:26] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Creepy
[00:58:41] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> It's still in progress.
[00:58:46] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Creepy was what I was going for though :D
[00:59:10] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Need to gather up some cobwebs for atmosphere ;D
[00:59:20] [Async Chat Thread - #61/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I don't have a silk touch though :(

[01:03:57] [Async Chat Thread - #62/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> New feature. Wool blocks naturally occurring in the mines.
[01:04:29] [Async Chat Thread - #62/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> there's a fancy creeper bullying me in the mine :'(
[01:04:55] [Async Chat Thread - #62/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> ....Wool in the mines?
[01:05:10] [Async Chat Thread - #62/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Are you sure it's not a bone block?
[01:05:15] [Async Chat Thread - #62/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> it's wool
[01:05:18] [Async Chat Thread - #62/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> justin's wool
[01:05:21] [Async Chat Thread - #62/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Oh lol
[01:05:27] [Async Chat Thread - #62/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I was tssssnneaking behind him and putting the blocks where he was trying to strip mine
[01:07:05] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> i miss my diamond pickaxe :'(
[01:07:07] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> So did you run out of saplings for the jungle trees?

[01:08:22] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Well. When you mine out an enormous room there tend to be some found :D
[01:08:36] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Also, I found a single diamond...
[01:08:38] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> nice

[01:09:04] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> i can wait tho
[01:09:15] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Might as well do it, it only takes 3.
[01:09:25] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> for 2-3 enchantments?
[01:09:28] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> on 1 tool?

[01:09:45] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> but i think it still is the random amount like it was before.
[01:09:46] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> did u use lapiz stuff?
[01:09:49] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Yeah
[01:09:52] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> You have to.

[01:10:52] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> that looks like wood :P
[01:10:56] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I know :(
[01:11:08] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I can't put an anvil on the ceiling though
[01:11:22] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> u can if u believe
[01:11:41] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> :O how you do that?
[01:11:46] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> shield
[01:11:47] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> ?
[01:11:51] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Yeah.
[01:11:54] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> uh
[01:12:03] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> think slingshot with wood and then silver top middle
[01:12:37] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Yay!
[01:12:43] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I was about to make those lol
[01:12:55] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Hahaha, I saw your design and knew exactly what you were going for.
[01:13:09] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> you can still put them on the chests too, right?
[01:13:20] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I think so, it's been a while.
[01:13:32] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I like this better.
[01:13:44] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> unless you got single wide chests.
[01:13:53] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> It just looks weird.
[01:14:14] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> that's bc it's not in an upsidedown glass pyramid surrounded by lava
[01:14:31] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> fml
[01:14:33] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> no
[01:14:34] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> ?
[01:14:42] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> You can fix it.
[01:14:42] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> there's a flaw in ur design
[01:14:48] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Yeah i know.
[01:14:49] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> of the enchanting room
[01:14:56] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> i'm stuck :(
[01:14:57] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> :D
[01:15:01] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Do you have a block?
[01:15:20] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> ps you're wrong
[01:15:22] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I haven't got the lava for the pits yet :D
[01:15:24] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> i could use 30 lvls
[01:15:34] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> How do you use 30?
[01:15:45] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> i have options 3, 17, and 30
[01:15:50] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Yup.
[01:15:56] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> and it takes 1 2 or 3 levels
[01:16:11] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Enchantment lvl 30 takes 3 player levels.
[01:16:22] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> what am i missing then
[01:16:27] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> lapis?
[01:16:31] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> it said player level 30
[01:16:37] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Hmm...
[01:16:42] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> let's try more lapiz
[01:16:50] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Maybe you need to be 30+?
[01:16:56] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> probz
[01:17:00] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> i'm 5
[01:17:08] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Lemme see your pick. I got more than enough.
[01:17:42] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> idk what we're going for. Unbreakable, fortune, etc
[01:17:44] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Thanks!
[01:17:52] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I needed another one of those
[01:18:18] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> lvl 30?
[01:18:26] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Yup
[01:18:31] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> I like the unbreaking but I figured it could have fortune or something. oh well
[01:18:43] [Async Chat Thread - #63/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> you can't be picky with enchanting :(
[01:19:49] [Async Chat Thread - #64/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> oh, for when u ask tomorrow, we're leaving Cville @ 1pm for Strangefold

[01:32:49] [Async Chat Thread - #66/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I suppose they don't WANT you to be able to do that...
[01:33:48] [Async Chat Thread - #66/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Good picks are so ridiculous compared to the regular ole iron ones lol
[01:33:53] [Async Chat Thread - #66/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> yup
[01:33:58] [Async Chat Thread - #66/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> iron picks make me sad
[01:34:02] [Async Chat Thread - #66/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Enchanted too, or just diamond?
[01:34:23] [Async Chat Thread - #66/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> well, mine is diamond unbreaking now so avrage diamond speed here
[01:34:46] [Async Chat Thread - #66/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I guess I'm gonna have to re-learn the enchanting system...

[01:35:12] [Async Chat Thread - #66/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Random :(
[01:35:24] [Async Chat Thread - #66/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Usually you get at least 2 for the lvl 30 ones :/
[01:35:27] [Async Chat Thread - #66/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> still, mine is 1/3rd as good as that
[01:35:28] [Async Chat Thread - #66/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> yeah
