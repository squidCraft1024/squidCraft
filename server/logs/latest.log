[21:32:44] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Yo.
[21:32:54] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Hey! You've not been on in awhile!
[21:33:01] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I kind of rearranged the farms a bit.
[21:33:11] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Yeah XD I keep forgetting people are playing Minecraft...
[21:33:26] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I noticed! I was cleaning up the layout a bit and was gonna plant some more stuff!
[21:34:12] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I'm going to try and create a minecart haul away system for the chests that are on the ground random
[21:34:17] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> randomly throughout the place.
[21:34:27] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Although I don't think I like how it looks right now
[21:34:33] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> That would be awesome...
[21:34:37] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Also, do you know what changed with slimes?
[21:34:44] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> They don't seem to be in the swamp
[21:34:49] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Not specifically...
[21:35:05] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I know it USED to be they spawned underground in specific chunks determined by seed...
[21:35:30] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I used to be able to find them in swamps just about any time.
[21:35:44] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Maybe they removed the spawning in swamp thing...
[21:35:54] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I used to just build a farm when I found them underground....
[21:36:51] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Also, rearranging the farm made me have more issues with courtney's carrot hidey hole :(
[21:37:00] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> errr.. secret underground thing there.
[21:37:11] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Uh oh, what happened?
[21:37:16] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I moved it :P
[21:37:26] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> two blocks to the left and one block up
[21:37:38] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I know she was....building directly under the farm...because some trees tried to grow through the gr
[21:37:50] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I also lowered it a bit.
[21:39:57] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Yeah, i didn't fix the lighting lol
[21:40:26] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> you don't need to do that
[21:40:35] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> you can till the grass
[21:40:41] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Oh, really?
[21:40:45] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> yeah
[21:41:55] [Async Chat Thread - #2/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> This formation happened to work out perfectly for the wheat farm
[21:42:06] [Async Chat Thread - #2/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> it's got 3x the stuff as the other ones
[21:50:46] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> also, my plan was to make a better animal pen up here so we could have enough chickens for feathers
[21:50:49] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> and junk like that
[21:50:59] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> That's be awesome...
[21:51:17] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> *That'd
[21:51:37] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Although, the other animals seem to be escaping
[21:51:48] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> We might also want space to keep rabbits and pigs, too...
[21:52:03] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Can you keep rabbits?
[21:52:20] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I assume you can...if they work like other mobs.
[21:52:22] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I saw them but they just ran away lol
[21:57:23] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> want to make it daytime?
[21:57:37] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Yeah, gimme a sec
[21:57:40] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Or do you want xp instead :P
