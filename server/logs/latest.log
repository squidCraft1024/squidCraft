[00:15:53] [Async Chat Thread - #14/INFO]: <DrBananasDDS> maybe I'll join you by digging to you
[00:16:00] [Server thread/WARN]: Horse moved wrongly!
[00:16:07] [Async Chat Thread - #14/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> i might work on farming tho
[00:16:20] [Async Chat Thread - #14/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I have a small farm set up...
[00:16:24] [Async Chat Thread - #14/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Nothing fancy...
[00:16:35] [Async Chat Thread - #14/INFO]: <tofu6465> im still building a house
[00:16:39] [Async Chat Thread - #14/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> I NEED A FANCY FARM
[00:17:26] [Async Chat Thread - #14/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> oh shit
[00:17:44] [Async Chat Thread - #14/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> there may be a stronghold

[00:18:08] [Async Chat Thread - #14/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> swore i saw it glitched through the unloaded blocks
[00:18:49] [Async Chat Thread - #14/INFO]: <DrBananasDDS> dude, I have no idea what direction you are even in Andy, I can't get the map to load
[00:18:59] [Async Chat Thread - #14/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> the gps coords are enough
[00:19:05] [Async Chat Thread - #14/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> south-west of the village to teh east
[00:19:30] [Async Chat Thread - #14/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> WE DON'T NEED to mess wtih it until we're a bit fartehr tho
[00:19:54] [Async Chat Thread - #14/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> we have no business there now
[00:20:09] [Async Chat Thread - #14/INFO]: <DrBananasDDS> I'm trying to find Andy, not You
[00:22:00] [Async Chat Thread - #15/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> oh god
[00:22:12] [Async Chat Thread - #15/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> rip bridge
[00:22:14] [Async Chat Thread - #15/INFO]: <DrBananasDDS> found some iron ore
[00:22:18] [Async Chat Thread - #15/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Nice!
[00:27:01] [Async Chat Thread - #16/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> u have a steel pickaxe, right?
[00:27:06] [Async Chat Thread - #16/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> iron
[00:27:14] [Async Chat Thread - #16/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Uhhh...no, not yet.
[00:27:21] [Async Chat Thread - #16/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> u want one? i'm not using mine
[00:27:23] [Async Chat Thread - #16/INFO]: <DrBananasDDS> nah, and I normally just stick with stone
[00:27:25] [Async Chat Thread - #16/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Sure!
[00:27:32] [Async Chat Thread - #16/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> and there's also enough iron for another lolol
[00:32:08] [Server thread/INFO]: tofu6465 has just earned the achievement [Monster Hunter]
[00:32:20] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> water allows for a radius of 8 farming?
[00:32:25] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> can't remember how far it goes
[00:32:42] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> maybe 4 :(
[00:32:45] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I think a diameter of 9? If water is the center.
[00:32:53] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> yeah, so radius 4
[00:32:56] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> :(
[00:33:29] [Server thread/WARN]: Horse moved wrongly!
[00:33:55] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Do you think it's better to prioretize planting space or ease of use?
[00:34:19] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> i figure both if we can. I'm avoiding farming right next to the pond bc it'd be a pain
[00:34:45] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Yeah, I put some stuff in there just because I didn't know where the best place to go would be...
[00:34:56] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> tthat spot is alright tho
[00:34:59] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I was thinking it might be good to do one of those farms with the flowing water by it...
[00:35:17] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> It carries everything to the end...
[00:35:27] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> you gotta release the water in 1 spot, right?
[00:35:53] [Server thread/INFO]: tofu6465 has just earned the achievement [Getting an Upgrade]
[00:35:53] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> There are some that work that way, but I was thinking less high tech than that.
[00:36:16] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Hm, actually, with dispensers an easy farming setup might not be that hard...
[00:36:22] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> i don't know what u mean by stream that carries stuff
[00:36:32] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> eh, we need redstone i think for dispenser, right?
[00:36:46] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Yeah.
[00:36:46] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> who died
[00:36:58] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> oh ben lol
[00:37:00] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <DrBananasDDS> no one?
[00:37:00] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Do you have a pattern you guys like mining in?
[00:37:03] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <DrBananasDDS> oh
[00:37:04] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <tofu6465> i didnt die
[00:37:14] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> i like the lines 3 apart but directino is hard
[00:37:15] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <DrBananasDDS> no, I'm just going in one direction now
[00:37:21] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> hopefully we can find the caves from b4
[00:37:35] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> how do u have that much food in the mine cney?
[00:37:44] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Yeah, I was thinking I'd let you handle that since you'd found some caves and spawners.
[00:37:51] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <DrBananasDDS> I killed a cow, got 3 meats, cooked them, used only 1 so far
[00:37:56] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> jeez
[00:38:46] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <DrBananasDDS> I just hope taht i'm digging in the direction of town, but I'll never know
[00:39:00] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> where'd u start?
[00:39:13] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <DrBananasDDS> I really have know idea
[00:39:16] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> ur not vevry close to town
[00:39:22] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <DrBananasDDS> how do you get the map to show
[00:39:23] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> u have to dig through a pond
[00:39:33] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> don't include www in the address and it works
[00:39:39] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <DrBananasDDS> you mean under a pond
[00:39:43] [Async Chat Thread - #17/INFO]: <Duckmaster09> maybe
