[21:32:44] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Yo.
[21:32:54] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Hey! You've not been on in awhile!
[21:33:01] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I kind of rearranged the farms a bit.
[21:33:11] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Yeah XD I keep forgetting people are playing Minecraft...
[21:33:26] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I noticed! I was cleaning up the layout a bit and was gonna plant some more stuff!
[21:34:12] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I'm going to try and create a minecart haul away system for the chests that are on the ground random
[21:34:17] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> randomly throughout the place.
[21:34:27] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Although I don't think I like how it looks right now
[21:34:33] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> That would be awesome...
[21:34:37] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Also, do you know what changed with slimes?
[21:34:44] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> They don't seem to be in the swamp
[21:34:49] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Not specifically...
[21:35:05] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I know it USED to be they spawned underground in specific chunks determined by seed...
[21:35:30] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I used to be able to find them in swamps just about any time.
[21:35:44] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Maybe they removed the spawning in swamp thing...
[21:35:54] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I used to just build a farm when I found them underground....
[21:36:51] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Also, rearranging the farm made me have more issues with courtney's carrot hidey hole :(
[21:37:00] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> errr.. secret underground thing there.
[21:37:11] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Uh oh, what happened?
[21:37:16] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I moved it :P
[21:37:26] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> two blocks to the left and one block up
[21:37:38] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I know she was....building directly under the farm...because some trees tried to grow through the gr
[21:37:50] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I also lowered it a bit.
[21:39:57] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Yeah, i didn't fix the lighting lol
[21:40:26] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> you don't need to do that
[21:40:35] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> you can till the grass
[21:40:41] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Oh, really?
[21:40:45] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> yeah
[21:41:55] [Async Chat Thread - #2/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> This formation happened to work out perfectly for the wheat farm
[21:42:06] [Async Chat Thread - #2/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> it's got 3x the stuff as the other ones
[21:50:46] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> also, my plan was to make a better animal pen up here so we could have enough chickens for feathers
[21:50:49] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> and junk like that
[21:50:59] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> That's be awesome...
[21:51:17] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> *That'd
[21:51:37] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Although, the other animals seem to be escaping
[21:51:48] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> We might also want space to keep rabbits and pigs, too...
[21:52:03] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Can you keep rabbits?
[21:52:20] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I assume you can...if they work like other mobs.
[21:52:22] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I saw them but they just ran away lol
[21:57:23] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> want to make it daytime?
[21:57:37] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Yeah, gimme a sec
[21:57:40] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Or do you want xp instead :P
[22:04:08] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> well... it's not fast but it seems to work in theory XD
[22:18:27] [Async Chat Thread - #6/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> lol... there's a sheep down here in my gathering tunnel
[22:18:34] [Async Chat Thread - #6/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> lol
[22:23:43] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> do we need to sleep now?
[22:23:52] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Sounds good to me
[22:27:06] [Async Chat Thread - #8/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> I think there might be an enderman in attack mode.
[22:32:48] [Async Chat Thread - #9/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> what ya looking for?
[22:32:57] [Async Chat Thread - #9/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Just curious what's in every box.
[22:33:09] [Async Chat Thread - #9/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> It's only semi-sorted
[22:35:46] [Async Chat Thread - #10/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Have we built a Nether Portal yet?
[22:36:06] [Async Chat Thread - #10/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> No, I was going to do a cool door thing with stickypistons but I couldn't find the slimes :(
[22:36:19] [Async Chat Thread - #10/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> ...Right, those damn slimes are holding us up lol
[22:36:32] [Async Chat Thread - #10/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Can't do anything with sticky pistons yet....
[22:36:37] [Async Chat Thread - #10/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Or the ropes for animals...
[22:47:34] [Async Chat Thread - #11/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Wanna sleep?
[23:02:18] [Async Chat Thread - #12/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> wanna sleep?
[23:22:59] [Async Chat Thread - #13/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> O_O
[23:23:15] [Async Chat Thread - #13/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> what's this? lol
[23:23:28] [Async Chat Thread - #13/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I wanna experiment with giant mushroom growth.
[23:23:38] [Async Chat Thread - #13/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> And this is cocoa beans.
[23:23:44] [Async Chat Thread - #13/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> ahh
[23:27:57] [Async Chat Thread - #14/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> Silly jungle trees... they hopefully give you back the sapling it took to grow it XD
[23:28:12] [Async Chat Thread - #14/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> I hate how low that drop rate is ~_~
[23:31:11] [Async Chat Thread - #15/INFO]: <ubermensch1024> It's getting late for this old man. I'm off to real sleep :P
[23:31:18] [Async Chat Thread - #15/INFO]: <Dejitaru_Davis> Alrighty! See ya!
